# Human Body API

A Spring Boot project that aims to provide an API describing the composition and functioning of the human body in terms of application domain code.

## üéØ Purpose

The main goal of this project is to model the complex systems of the human body as a software application. This includes representing its composition (like proteins, fats, carbohydrates, hormones, tissues, organs, etc.) and its functions through a well-defined API.

It serves as a conceptual and educational exploration, translating biological concepts into software engineering principles.
